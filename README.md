# Cricket Umpire Counter

A simple utility to help count deliveries as a cricket umpire.

Once installed, the app can be found in the activities list.

The count can be incremented by pressing the ENTER (or equivalent) key on the watch, or by swiping UP on the watch face.
The count can be decremented by swiping DOWN on the watch face.

The watch will do a short vibration every time it increments. It will vibrate twice when there are two deliveries remaining, and once slightly longer when there is one delivery remaining. At the end of an over, the count is reset and the watch will do a long vibration.
